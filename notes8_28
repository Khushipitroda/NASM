when you do input and output in nasm you only can input and output strings of characters.

interrupt 80h
int 0x80 or int 80h
80h-both lets you input a string or output a string to tell nasm what interrupt to execute.

global _start is a dirrective, which makes start avilable for all linked files
_start: is where start begins

general purpose registers-these are in processor(hardware registers). they are used by the interrupt 80h
eax-extended, 32bit registers
ebx
ecx
edx


edx= length of string
ecx= address of string to output
ebx= 1(for stdout)
eax=4(value for innerupt for output)

b1 is a label, for debugging so you could stop at b1, loops and ifstatements

dec-decrement
