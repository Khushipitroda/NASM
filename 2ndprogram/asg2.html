<h3>        COSC 2331 Assignment #2 </h3>
<b> Due Date: Friday, September 11, 2009 by 5pm
</b>
<p>
Your assignment is to write a NASM program that prompts the user
to enter a string of up to 70 chars.  It should echo the original
string back to the user, then capitalize all letters, echo it back,
then lower case all letters and echo it back.

Be sure your program outputs appropriate messages, spaces, 
 and newline chars as the output is produced.
You will write your entire program in assembly language so you will
 assemble it, link it, and then execute it.<p>
<b> Example for creating this program and running it</b>
<br />
<ol>
<li>
Create prog2.asm using your editor: &nbsp&nbsp
<span class="blue"> emacs prog2.asm </span>
<li>
Assemble prog2.asm using nasm: &nbsp&nbsp 
<span class="blue"> nasm -f elf prog2.asm </span>
<li>
Link your prog2.o: &nbsp&nbsp
<span class="blue"> ld -m elf_i386 prog2.o </span>
<li>
Execute your program:  &nbsp&nbsp
<span class="blue"> ./a.out </span>
</ol>
